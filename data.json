An in-depth psychological study of a human soul by Fyodor Dostoevsky. A story about a person who tried to become great by committing a sin but could not bear the emotional torture that came with it.",

I am that Anime fan that would not watch all 500 episodes of Naruto and instead will go to wiki, read summary and watch only those episodes that seem interesting. My all-time favourite is 'The Basketball that Kuroko plays'.",
